          back in the Summer of 2020 and landed on InEvent. We are very happy

          of video streams.

          Our engagement has dramatically improved, and so also our events.
          InEvent's got this gamification feature, which I think is very
          interesting. We've been able to leverage polls and quizzes in an
          absolutely easy and manageable way. To see people respond to the
          survey, react live, and ask questions were key success factors.

InEvent was always on-the-ball with any
questions that I may have. They were very quick
to address issues.
