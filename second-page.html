          Coca-Cola was created in 1886 in Atlanta, Georgia. It is an American
          multinational company that manufactures and markets non-alcoholic
          beverages. In 1899, the Coca-Cola Company began bottling operations
          with franchisees in the United States. Today it has more than 500
          brands in 200 countries.
          <p>
            One of its headquarters in the world, Coca-Cola India, performed an
            event on January 12th and 13th, 2017, for its franchisees, which
            Coca affectionately calls 'Bottlers'. The One System Conference 2017
            is an event for franchisees to unite, act and grow into an one
            single system.

        The goal of Coca-Cola was to bring innovation to the event and automate
        all processes. In addition to that, they also wanted an efficient
        application with good usability for the attendees. The event was
        attended by the president of Coca-Cola Pacific, Coca-Cola India,
        executives of Coca-Cola Asia and more than 250 bottlers.

        In their event, the InEvent Analytics possibilities had a great impact
        to leverage the attendee experience. Each booth had a set goal for their
        target audience. When the target audience stopped by they were presented
        with a gift. The director presented which were the most visited booths
        using our beacon technology. Display screens were used to show the
        technology present during the event. Another strategy that made a
        difference for Coca Cola was InEvent RSVP. Days before the event,
        notifications were sent by Coca-Cola's event app aiming to confirm the
        presence of each pre-registered guest list in a quick and custom
        fashion. In the event, printers were used. The check-in took place
        automated and without queues. Each group was named with one of the
        Coca-Cola products. After the registration, the attendees received the
        password to access the app, ensuring the security and privacy of the
        attendees when sharing relevant information. Also, the NFC tags at
        entrances were essential to track attendees digitally as they come in
        and go out, eliminating the need for paper tickets or emails.

        The app for the event was customized with the logo and information to
        fit the event’s needs, simplifying the management processes and thinking
        about user experience. Configurations and mail automation were set up in
        order to send custom forms for the attendees to register and to download
        the app. For Coca Cola, one of the remarkable tools was NFC tags, for
        management and control of the fast and easy registration process. In
        addition to reducing the risks of event access fraud, it monitors the
        average time where each participant stayed in the booths, talks, and
        presentations of the event. Besides that, the NFC technology was also
        essential to leverage the attendee experience. With that tool, attendees
        could simply tap at entry points to register or check-in, making the
        process quick and convenient. By tracking attendees' activity through
        NFC devices, Coca Cola could collect valuable data on participation
        patterns, participant preferences, and the effectiveness of certain
        areas or activities of the event, enabling future improvements.
